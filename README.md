# CVproject_Tree_Identification
Computer vison project with the objective of locating the position of trees in some sample images. CV techniques, implemented in C++ using the OpenCV library, are used to identify all possible sub-images of trees and then they were classified with a Convolutional Neural Network coded in python using TensorFlow.
